# Unreal Engine Manual

Covers UE core concepts, architecture, and best practices. See frontmatter `compatibility` field for supported engine versions.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when the user asks about UE development — creating game logic, designing levels, Blueprint/C++ decisions, debugging, networking, or understanding engine behavior. Also use when a Unity-to-UE transition question arises (see Appendix).

## Editor UI Basics

UE's editor is organized into collapsible, dockable panels. The core four:

| Panel | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Viewport** | Interactive 3D scene view. Click to select, drag to move. |
| **World Outliner** (right side) | Hierarchical list of all Actors in all loaded levels. Double-click to focus camera on an Actor. |
| **Details Panel** (bottom right) | Shows properties of the currently selected Actor. Edit Location/Rotation/Scale, components, materials here. |
| **Content Browser** (bottom) | Your project's asset files. Drag-and-drop assets into the viewport to place them. |

**Viewport navigation:**

| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| Orbit camera | Hold **Right Mouse Button** + move mouse |
| Pan (slide view) | Hold **Middle Mouse Button** + move mouse |
| Zoom | **Scroll wheel** or hold RMB + scroll wheel |
| Focus on selected Actor | Press **F** |
| Fly-through mode | Hold **RMB** + **W/A/S/D** (hold Shift to speed up) |
| Snap to floor | Select Actor → press **End** |
| Bookmark camera position | **Ctrl + 1~9** to save, **1~9** to recall |

**Transform modes** (same as Unity):

| Key | Mode |
|---|---|
| **W** | Move (translate) |
| **E** | Rotate |
| **R** | Scale |
| **Space** | Toggle world/local coordinate gizmo |
| **End** | Snap object to floor/surface |

**PIE (Play In Editor):** Click the **Play** button in toolbar. Three modes: Play (fullscreen), VR Preview, Simulate (run logic without possessing a player).

## Coordinate System & Units

UE uses a **left-handed coordinate system, Z-up** (Unity uses left-handed, Y-up):

| Axis | UE | Unity |
|---|---|---|
| Forward | **+X** | +Z |
| Right | **+Y** | +X |
| Up | **+Z** | +Y |
| Unit | **Centimeters** (1 unit = 1 cm) | **Meters** (1 unit = 1 m) |

A 180 cm character = 180 UE units tall (same character is 1.8 in Unity).

**Importing models:** Maya/Max export with Y-up → enable "Convert Scene" on import. Blender's FBX exporter auto-converts. FBX import scale is typically 1.0 (cm), but always verify in the import dialog's "Transform" section.

Rotation order: UE uses **X→Y→Z** (Roll→Pitch→Yaw). Yaw = Z rotation.

## Project Setup

### Creating a New Project

In Epic Games Launcher → **Unreal Engine** tab → **Launch** → pick your engine version → **New Project**. Template selection:

| Template | What You Get |
|---|---|
| Blank | Empty project, no starter content |
| First Person | FPS character + level + Enhanced Input |
| Third Person | TPS character + level + Enhanced Input |
| Top Down | Top-down camera + click-to-move |
| Vehicle | Driveable vehicle + physics |
| Handheld AR | AR mobile template |

Enable **Starter Content** for a library of basic props/materials/textures.

### Engine Association

The `.uproject` file links to a specific engine version:

```json
"EngineAssociation": "5.4"     // Launcher-installed version
"EngineAssociation": "{GUID}"  // Custom/source-built engine
```

- Double-click `.uproject` → opens in associated engine
- Right-click `.uproject` → **Switch Unreal Engine Version** → choose another installed version
- Upgrading between versions: UE auto-converts the project, but **always back up first**

### Project Migration

Move a project to another machine: copy the entire project folder. Delete `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, and `DerivedDataCache/` before copying to save space — UE regenerates them.

### Editor Preferences

Key settings for Unity switchers:

| Setting | Location | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Invert Middle Mouse Pan | Editor Preferences → Level Editor → Viewports | Enable for Unity-like pan |
| Editor Language | Editor Preferences → Region & Language | Set to English if preferred |
| Source Code Editor | Editor Preferences → Source Code | VS 2022 (default) or Rider |

## Actor / Component Architecture

Every object in the game world is an **Actor**. An Actor itself does nothing — it's a container for **Components**.

### Core Principles

- **Actor** = spatial identity (transform, lifespan, network role) + a list of Components
- **Component** = reusable behaviour module (mesh, collision, audio, movement, custom logic)
- **RootComponent** = the one Component that defines the Actor's transform in the world
- Actors normally have a RootComponent — without one, the Actor has no world position
- Components attach in a tree: child Components move relative to their parent

### The Actor Hierarchy

```
UObject              ← garbage-collected base (everything is a UObject)
  UActorComponent    ← non-spatial component (movement, abilities)
    USceneComponent  ← has a transform, can be attached in a tree
      UPrimitiveComponent ← renders or collides (StaticMesh, SkeletalMesh, Shape)
  AActor             ← exists in the level, contains Components
    APawn            ← can be possessed by a Controller (player or AI)
      ACharacter     ← Pawn + capsule collision + movement + skeleton
```

### Common Patterns

**C++:**
```cpp
// Spawn an actor into the world
AActor* NewActor = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AMyActor>(SpawnClass, Location, Rotation);

// Find a component on this actor
UStaticMeshComponent* Mesh = FindComponentByClass<UStaticMeshComponent>();

// Get first actor of a class in the level (avoid in performance code)
AMyActor* Found = Cast<AMyActor>(UGameplayStatics::GetActorOfClass(GetWorld(), AMyActor::StaticClass()));

// Get the player's pawn
APawn* PlayerPawn = UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerPawn(GetWorld(), 0);
```

**Blueprint:** Right-click in Event Graph → search `Spawn Actor From Class` → select class.

### Key Rules

- **Never** use `new` to create UObjects or Actors — use `NewObject<T>()` or `SpawnActor<T>()`
- Destroy with `Actor->Destroy()` — the garbage collector handles UObject cleanup
- To disable an Actor: `SetActorHiddenInGame(true)` + `SetActorEnableCollision(false)` — or destroy it
- To disable a Component: `Component->SetActive(false)` (stops Tick + rendering + collision)
- An Actor with no RootComponent has no world position — always provide one

## Game Framework Classes

UE provides a structured game framework. Understanding these classes is essential before writing any logic.

### Framework Overview

| Class | Owner | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **GameMode** | Server only | Rules of the game (scoring, win conditions, spawning). Exists only on server. |
| **GameState** | Replicated to all | Game-wide state visible to all players (score, match timer, team data) |
| **PlayerController** | Each player | Translates input into actions. Owns the camera. Owns the HUD. |
| **PlayerState** | Replicated to all | Per-player state (name, score, ping). Survives player respawn. |
| **Pawn** | Controller | Physical avatar in the world. Can be possessed/unpossessed. |
| **Character** | Controller | Specialized Pawn with CapsuleComponent + CharacterMovement + SkeletalMesh |
| **HUD** | PlayerController | Legacy on-screen display. UMG Widgets preferred in modern UE5. |
| **GameInstance** | Persistent | Created on game start, destroyed on quit. Survives level transitions. |

### Data Flow

```
GameInstance (persistent)
  └─ GameMode (server only, per level)
       └─ GameState (replicated to all, per level)
            ├─ PlayerState A (replicated, per player)
            └─ PlayerState B (replicated, per player)
                 ├─ PlayerController A (per player, owns camera)
                 │    └─ Pawn A (possessed)
                 └─ PlayerController B (per player)
                      └─ Pawn B (possessed)
```

### Setting Default Classes

In **Project Settings → Maps & Modes**:
- Default GameMode → your custom GameMode
- Default Pawn Class → your custom Pawn/Character
- Default PlayerController → your custom PlayerController

Or in `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`:
```ini
[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]
GameDefaultMap=/Game/Maps/MainLevel
GlobalDefaultGameMode=/Game/Blueprints/BP_MyGameMode.BP_MyGameMode_C
```

### Common Pitfall

GameMode exists ONLY on the server. Never access GameMode from client code — use GameState instead (replicated to clients).

---

## Lifecycle: Actor Initialization

### Execution Order (simplified)

1. **Constructor** (C++ only) — set default property values. No world access, no gameplay logic.
2. **PostInitializeComponents()** — all Components created. Can reference own Components here.
3. **BeginPlay()** — called once when game starts (or actor is spawned). Safe for gameplay logic.
4. **Tick(float DeltaTime)** — called every frame (if enabled). DeltaTime varies, don't assume fixed timestep.
5. **EndPlay()** — called when destroyed or level unloads. Cleanup here.

### C++ Example
```cpp
AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
    // Constructor: set defaults only
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
    Strength = 100.0f;
}

void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    // Safe for gameplay initialization
    if (UWorld* World = GetWorld())
    {
        // World exists, safe to use
    }
}

void AMyActor::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
    // Per-frame logic. DeltaTime varies.
}
```

**Blueprint:** Event Graph → right-click → `Event BeginPlay` / `Event Tick` nodes.

### Common Pitfalls

- Accessing `GetWorld()` in constructor → **nullptr**. Use `BeginPlay()` or `PostInitializeComponents()`.
- Heavy work in `Tick()` → drags framerate. Enable/disable `PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick` per Actor.
- `BeginPlay()` runs on both server and clients (for replicated actors). Be careful with authority checks.
- Forgetting `Super::BeginPlay()` in C++ → parent class init is skipped.

### CDO Constructor & Asset Loading

`ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder` in the CDO constructor can silently fail in UE5 with World Partition active. Asset registry may not be fully initialized during CDO construction.

**Recommended fix (in order of preference):**
1. **Blueprint subclass** — `UCLASS(abstract)`, create BP child, set assets in Class Defaults
2. **BeginPlay fallback** — `LoadObject<T>(nullptr, TEXT("/Game/Path/To/Asset.Asset"))` if member is null
3. **StaticLoadObject** — `Cast<T>(StaticLoadObject(T::StaticClass(), nullptr, TEXT("/Game/...")))`

Applies to: `USkeletalMesh`, `UAnimMontage`, `UInputAction`, `UInputMappingContext`.

**After full rebuild:** Blueprint CDO may retain old serialized values overriding new C++ defaults. Check BP Class Defaults for critical properties (`MaxHP`, damage values, etc.).

### Hot Reload vs Full Rebuild

| Change | Action |
|---|---|
| Modify existing function body (.cpp) | Ctrl+Alt+F11 (Live Coding) |
| Add new UFUNCTION/UCLASS declaration | Full rebuild |
| Modify Build.cs dependencies | Full rebuild |
| Change BlueprintImplementableEvent | Live Coding (BP side implements) |

**Rebuild steps:** Close editor → delete `Binaries/` + `Intermediate/` → Generate VS files → reopen.

## C++ vs Blueprint

UE gives you two ways to build logic. Both are valid. Most commercial projects use both.

### When to Use C++
- Complex math, algorithms, heavy computation
- Low-level systems (custom movement, networking optimization)
- Data structures, asset processing
- Anything that runs every frame on many objects
- Plugin or engine modification

### When to Use Blueprint
- Event-driven logic (on overlap, on damage, on interact)
- UI binding, animation graphs, audio logic
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Level-specific scripting (doors, triggers, pickups)
- Simple game rules, cosmetics, VFX

### How They Work Together

UE's reflection system binds C++ to Blueprint:

```cpp
// C++ side: expose this class to Blueprint
UCLASS(Blueprintable)        // BP can inherit from this
class AMyCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
    float Health;             // BP can read/write

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    void TakeDamage(float Amount);  // BP can call this
};
```

Then in Blueprint, create a child of `AMyCharacter`, override events, and call C++ functions.

### Key Principle

**C++ = foundation. Blueprint = skin.** Write performance-critical systems in C++, expose knobs to Blueprint for designers to tweak.

## Blueprint Fundamentals

Blueprints are visual scripts — no C++ required. Every Blueprint has two main tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Event Graph** | Gameplay logic: events, function calls, branching, loops. Runs at runtime. |
| **Construction Script** | Runs once when the Actor is placed/edited in the level. Use for setting up mesh variants, material parameters, procedural generation at edit time. |

### Common Node Types

| Node Type | Appearance | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Event** | Red title bar | Entry point. `Event BeginPlay`, `Event Tick`, `Event ActorBeginOverlap`. |
| **Function Call** | Blue title bar | Calls a C++ or Blueprint function. Has input/output pins. |
| **Pure Function** | Green title bar (no exec pins) | Reads data, no side effects. Evaluated on demand when its output is wired. |
| **Variable Get/Set** | Colored circle pins | Read or write a variable. |
| **Branch** | Diamond shape | If/else. |
| **ForLoop** | Loop body frame | Iterate N times. |
| **Delay** | Clock icon | Wait N seconds, then continue execution (latent — pauses the flow). |
| **Sequence** | Numbered outputs | Execute multiple output chains in order. |

### Variables in Blueprint

- **Create** by clicking `+` in the MyBlueprint panel (left sidebar)
- **Types**: Boolean, Integer, Float, Vector, Rotator, Actor/Object references, etc.
- **Instance Editable** checkbox → variable appears in Details panel, tweakable per Actor instance
- **Expose on Spawn** → value is set when you use `Spawn Actor From Class`
- **Tooltip field** → shows description on hover, good for designer documentation

### Macros vs Functions vs Custom Events

| | Macro | Function | Custom Event |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Where defined** | Macro Library or same BP | BP or C++ base class | Event Graph |
| **Can use Delay?** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Can have return value?** | ✅ Multiple output pins | ✅ One return value | ❌ No |
| **Execution cost** | Inlined (copied) at compile | Function call overhead | Lightweight dispatch |
| **Use for** | Reusable node groups (like a template) | Computation, getter/setter logic | Async notification, event dispatch |

## Blueprint Communication

How Blueprints talk to each other. Four patterns, increasing complexity:

### 1. Direct Reference (simplest)

Drag one Actor into another's Details panel or expose a variable:
```
UPROPERTY(EditInstanceOnly)  // pick target in the level editor
AActor* TargetActor;
```
Then call functions on `TargetActor` directly. Works only when both Actors are in the same level.

### 2. Casting

When you have a generic reference (Actor/ActorComponent) but need a specific class:

```
On Begin Overlap → Other Actor → Cast to BP_Enemy → If valid → Call TakeDamage
```

Casting is necessary but expensive in BP — cache the cast result. On Tick, avoid casting every frame.

### 3. Event Dispatcher (Observer pattern)

One Blueprint broadcasts an event; others listen and react. Decouples sender from receiver.

**Setup:**
1. In sender BP → MyBlueprint panel → `Event Dispatchers` → `+` → name it (e.g., `OnPlayerDied`)
2. Drag a `Call OnPlayerDied` node onto the Event Graph where the event should fire
3. In receiver BP → find sender → Details → Events → `OnPlayerDied` → click `+` → auto-creates Bind node
4. Wire Bind node Event pin to a Custom Event in receiver

**C++ equivalent:** `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE`

### 4. Blueprint Interface

Define a contract that any Blueprint can implement. Useful when different classes need to respond to the same message (human, AI, destructible object all respond to `TakeDamage`).

**Setup:**
1. Content Browser → right-click → Blueprints → **Blueprint Interface** → name it (e.g., `BPI_Damageable`)
2. Add function: `OnTakeDamage(float Amount)` — only input/output pins, no implementation body
3. In each Blueprint that should be "damageable": **Class Settings → Implemented Interfaces → Add** → pick your interface
4. In Event Graph, right-click → `Event OnTakeDamage` appears → wire your response logic
5. Caller: `BPI_Damageable → OnTakeDamage(Target, 50.0)` — works on ANY actor that implements the interface

### Communication Cheat Sheet

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Two known objects in same level | Direct reference |
| Generic reference → specific class | Cast (cache it) |
| Notify many listeners of an event | Event Dispatcher |
| Different classes, same behavior | Blueprint Interface |

---

## UE Modules (C++ Code Organization)

Modules are the primary way to organize C++ code in UE — equivalent to Unity's namespace + Assembly Definition. Each module is a self-contained compilation unit with its own dependencies, visibility rules, and loading behavior.

### Module Structure

A typical module directory under `Source/`:

```
Source/MyModule/
├── Public/                    ← headers exposed to other modules
│   └── MyActor.h
├── Private/                   ← implementation + headers internal to this module
│   ├── MyActor.cpp
│   └── MyModuleModule.cpp     ← module registration
└── MyModule.Build.cs          ← dependencies and build config
```

### .Build.cs — Dependency Declaration

Every module needs a `.Build.cs` file that declares its dependencies:

```csharp
// Source/MyModule/MyModule.Build.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class MyModule : ModuleRules
{
    public MyModule(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

        // Modules used in public headers — also exposed to modules that depend on you
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            "Core",
            "CoreUObject",
            "Engine"
        });

        // Modules used only in .cpp files — not exposed externally
        PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] {
            "Slate",
            "SlateCore",
            "EnhancedInput"
        });
    }
}
```

**Prefer PrivateDependencyModuleNames** whenever possible — it reduces compile times and enforces cleaner boundaries.

### Public vs Private Folders

| Folder | Visibility | What to put there |
|---|---|---|
| **Public/** | Accessible to any module that depends on yours | Headers for classes that other modules need to use |
| **Private/** | Only accessible within your module | .cpp files, internal headers, implementation details |

These are NOT related to the C++ `public`/`private` keywords — they control **cross-module** header visibility at build time.

### IMPLEMENT_MODULE — Registration

Every module needs a registration file (`Private/MyModuleModule.cpp`):

```cpp
#include "Modules/ModuleManager.h"

IMPLEMENT_MODULE(FDefaultModuleImpl, MyModule);
```

For modules that need startup/shutdown logic, implement `IModuleInterface`:

```cpp
#include "Modules/ModuleManager.h"

class FMyModule : public IModuleInterface
{
public:
    virtual void StartupModule() override
    {
        // Called when the module loads — register settings, bind delegates
    }

    virtual void ShutdownModule() override
    {
        // Called when the module unloads — cleanup
    }
};

IMPLEMENT_MODULE(FMyModule, MyModule);
```

### Module Configuration in .uproject

Define modules in your `.uproject` file:

```json
"Modules": [
    {
        "Name": "MyModule",
        "Type": "Runtime",
        "LoadingPhase": "Default"
    }
]
```

| Setting | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Type** | `Runtime`, `Editor`, `Developer`, `Program` | Where the module is available |
| **LoadingPhase** | `Default`, `PreDefault`, `PostConfigInit`, `PostEngineInit` | When the module loads |

Editor-only modules (tools, custom inspectors, editor extensions) use `Type: "Editor"` — they won't be included in packaged builds.

### API Export Macros

When a class in your module needs to be used by another module, mark it with your module's API macro:

```cpp
// In MyModule/Public/MyActor.h
#pragma once
#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "MyActor.generated.h"

class MYMODULE_API AMyActor : public AActor  // ← MYMODULE_API exports this class
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

Standard engine module API macros:

| Macro | Module |
|---|---|
| `CORE_API` | Core |
| `COREUOBJECT_API` | CoreUObject |
| `ENGINE_API` | Engine |
| `SLATE_API` | Slate |
| `UMG_API` | UMG |
| `AIMODULE_API` | AIModule |

Without the API macro, the class/function is invisible outside your module (linker error).

### UE's Use of C++ Namespaces

UE traditionally avoided C++ namespaces. Since UE 5.0+, they are gradually being adopted:

```cpp
// Modern UE (5.0+)
namespace UE::Math { /* math types */ }
namespace UE::Core { /* core utilities */ }
namespace UE::Online { /* online services */ }

// Usage
UE::Math::FVector Location;
```

However, **modules remain the primary organization unit**. Namespaces supplement modules but don't replace them. Most gameplay code still uses global scope with F/U/A/I prefixes (see below).

### Type Prefix Convention

UE uses letter prefixes as a naming convention (not enforced by the compiler, but critical for readability):

| Prefix | Base Class | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **F** | Plain struct/value type | `FVector`, `FString`, `FName`, `FTransform` |
| **U** | UObject and derivatives | `UObject`, `UActorComponent`, `UTexture`, `UDataAsset` |
| **A** | AActor and derivatives | `AActor`, `ACharacter`, `APawn`, `AGameModeBase` |
| **I** | Interface classes | `IInputDevice`, `ITargetPlatform` |
| **E** | Enums | `ECollisionChannel`, `EMovementMode` |
| **T** | Template/container classes | `TArray`, `TMap`, `TSharedPtr` |
| **S** | Slate widget classes | `SButton`, `STextBlock` |

These prefixes serve a pseudo-namespace role — you can immediately identify the base class of any type by its first letter.

### Module System Cheat Sheet

| Unity | Unreal |
|---|---|
| `namespace MyGame { }` | Module directory + `.Build.cs` |
| Assembly Definition | Module + dependency graph |
| `using` | `PublicDependencyModuleNames` / `PrivateDependencyModuleNames` |
| `internal` class | `Private/` folder |
| `public` class in assembly | `Public/` folder + API macro |
| Editor-only assembly | `Type: "Editor"` module |

---

## The Reflection System: UPROPERTY / UFUNCTION

UE's C++ is augmented by a pre-processor that generates reflection data. The macros `UCLASS`, `UPROPERTY`, and `UFUNCTION` are **not** standard C++ — they drive UE's serialization, editor integration, garbage collection, and networking.

### UPROPERTY Specifiers

```cpp
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)          // Show in editor details panel, editable
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadWrite)    // BP can get/set
UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)       // Show in editor but read-only
UPROPERTY(Replicated)            // Syncs from server to clients
UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_Health)  // Call OnRep_Health() on clients when changed
UPROPERTY(SaveGame)              // Serialized into save files
```

### UFUNCTION Specifiers

```cpp
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)       // BP can call this function
UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)  // BP writes the body, C++ calls it
UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent)    // C++ default body, BP can override
UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable)        // Called from client, executes on server (RPC)
UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable)        // Called from server, executes on client
UFUNCTION(NetMulticast, Reliable)  // Called from server, executes everywhere
```

### Common Pitfall

GENERATED_BODY() must be the first line inside the class body. Forgetting it causes compile errors.

### FString vs FName vs FText

UE has three string types with distinct purposes. Using the wrong one causes bugs:

| Type | Purpose | Internal | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FString** | General-purpose mutable string | Heap-allocated, UTF-16 | File paths, debug output, dynamic concatenation. Heavy — avoid in hot loops. |
| **FName** | Immutable interned identifier | Hashed, single-entry-per-string table | Asset names, tags, gameplay identifiers. Fast comparison (`==` is O(1)). Use for anything that acts as a "key". |
| **FText** | Localized display text | Key+table lookup for translations | UI text, dialogue, anything the player sees. Never use FString for visible text — it breaks localization. |

```cpp
// FString — general purpose
FString Path = TEXT("/Game/Maps/Level1");
FString Joined = FString::Printf(TEXT("Health: %d"), Health);

// FName — identifiers (fast comparison)
FName EnemyTag = FName(TEXT("Enemy"));
if (Actor->ActorHasTag(EnemyTag)) { /* O(1) comparison */ }

// FText — localized UI text
FText DisplayName = NSLOCTEXT("MyGame", "StartButton", "Start");
// NSLOCTEXT( namespace, key, default )
```

**Conversions:**
```cpp
FString FromName = Name.ToString();
FString FromText = Text.ToString();  // loses localization info
FName FromString = FName(*String);
FText FromString = FText::FromString(String);
```

**Blueprint:** Blueprint strings are all `FString` under the hood. Use the `ToText` node for UI display.

### Common Pitfalls

- ❌ `FString` for tag comparisons → use `FName` (faster, no allocation)
- ❌ `FString` for player-visible text → use `FText` (enables localization)
- ❌ `FText::FromString()` on dynamic runtime text → OK, but no localization at all for that text
- ❌ `FName` for constantly changing data (e.g., player names typed at runtime) → FName pool never shrinks, leaks memory

---

## Timers (FTimerManager)

UE's equivalent of Unity Coroutines. Schedule a function to run after a delay, or repeat at an interval.

### C++

```cpp
// Run once after 2 seconds
GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(MyTimerHandle, this, &AMyActor::DelayedExplode, 2.0f, false);

// Repeat every 0.5 seconds
GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(MyTickHandle, this, &AMyActor::PeriodicCheck, 0.5f, true);

// Pause / unpause
GetWorldTimerManager().PauseTimer(MyTimerHandle);
GetWorldTimerManager().UnPauseTimer(MyTimerHandle);

// Cancel
GetWorldTimerManager().ClearTimer(MyTimerHandle);

// Check if running
GetWorldTimerManager().IsTimerActive(MyTimerHandle);

// Lambda timer (inline function)
GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(MyHandle, [](){ UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Fired!")); }, 1.0f, false);
```

### Blueprint

Use **Delay** node for one-shot waits, or **Set Timer by Event / Set Timer by Function Name** for repeating logic:

| Node | Use |
|---|---|
| **Delay** | Wait N seconds then continue (latent — pauses execution flow) |
| **Set Timer by Event** | Wire a Custom Event as the callback, specify looping |
| **Set Timer by Function Name** | Call a function by name string |
| **Clear Timer by Handle** | Cancel a timer |
| **Pause / Unpause Timer by Handle** | Pause/resume |

### Timer Pitfalls

- Timers stop when their owning Actor is destroyed — no need to manually clean up if the Actor dies
- Check `IsTimerActive()` before setting a timer with the same handle to avoid double-scheduling
- `Delay` only works in latent functions (Event Graph, not Functions/Macros)
- Timer delegates in C++ use `FTimerHandle` — store as a member variable

---

## Level Management

### Core API

```cpp
// Open a level (replaces current)
UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(GetWorld(), FName("Level2"));

// Open with options (listen server, etc.)
UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(GetWorld(), FName("Level2"), true, "?listen");
```

**Blueprint:** `Open Level (by Name)` node.

### World Partition (UE5)

UE5's large-world system that streams only visible cells. Replaces the old World Composition from UE4.

- Enable in **World Settings → Enable World Partition**
- Each Actor is saved as a separate file (One File Per Actor / OFPA)
- `Content/__ExternalActors__/` stores OFPA data in hex-gridded subdirectories
- Data Layers control what streams when (gameplay variation, day/night, DLC)

**OFPA active** when `Content/__ExternalActors__/` + `Content/__ExternalObjects__/` exist. Implications: FObjectFinder less reliable in CDO constructor; each Actor saved as separate `.uasset`.

### Level Streaming (traditional)

Load/unload sub-levels at runtime:

```cpp
// Async load
ULevelStreamingDynamic* Level = ULevelStreamingDynamic::LoadLevelInstance(
    GetWorld(), "SubLevel", FVector::ZeroVector, FRotator::ZeroRotator, bOutSuccess);

// Unload
Level->SetShouldBeVisible(false);
```

---

## Render Pipeline (UE5)

UE5 has one unified renderer (unlike Unity's three pipelines), but with scalable features.

### Key Features

| Feature | What It Does | Enable |
|---|---|---|
| **Lumen** | Dynamic global illumination (no lightmap baking) | Project Settings → Rendering → Dynamic Global Illumination |
| **Nanite** | Virtualized geometry — no LOD authoring | Per mesh: enable Nanite on StaticMesh asset |
| **Virtual Shadow Maps** | High-res shadows with Nanite | Default enabled in UE5 |
| **TSR** (Temporal Super Resolution) | Upsampling for 60fps on consoles | Project Settings → Anti-aliasing |
| **Hardware Ray Tracing** | Accurate reflections, GI, shadows | Project Settings → Ray Tracing |
| **Substrate** (UE 5.5+) | Next-gen material system | Console var `r.Substrate 1` |
| **MegaLights** (UE 5.5+, experimental) | Hundreds of shadow-casting lights | Console var `r.MegaLights 1` |

### Graphics API

Check `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`:
```ini
DefaultGraphicsRHI=DefaultGraphicsRHI_DX12   # DirectX 12 (default UE5)
```

UE5 targets DX12 by default. Vulkan available on Linux/Android. No DX11 fallback for Nanite/Lumen.

### Scalability

UE scales features per quality level (Low/Medium/High/Epic). Set in **Settings → Engine Scalability**. Features like Lumen can be disabled on Low.

---

## Physics (Chaos)

UE5 uses Chaos physics (replacing PhysX from UE4).

### Collision Components

- **StaticMesh** → `UStaticMeshComponent` with `SetSimulatePhysics(false)` (default)  
- **Physics Body** → `UStaticMeshComponent` with `SetSimulatePhysics(true)`  
- **Character** → `ACharacter` uses CapsuleComponent for collision + CharacterMovementComponent for movement
- **Triggers** → any collision shape with `SetGenerateOverlapEvents(true)`

### Collision Responses

Each Component has a collision preset (NoCollision, BlockAll, OverlapAll, etc.) or custom per-channel response:
- **Block** → stops movement, fires OnComponentHit
- **Overlap** → no physics response, fires OnComponentBeginOverlap
- **Ignore** → no interaction

### Collision Events

```cpp
// C++ — bind in BeginPlay()
Mesh->OnComponentBeginOverlap.AddDynamic(this, &AMyActor::OnOverlapBegin);
Mesh->OnComponentHit.AddDynamic(this, &AMyActor::OnHit);

void AMyActor::OnOverlapBegin(UPrimitiveComponent* OverlappedComp, AActor* OtherActor,
    UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex, bool bFromSweep, const FHitResult& SweepResult)
{
    // Handle overlap
}
```

**Blueprint:** Select component → Details → Events → `OnComponentBeginOverlap` / `OnComponentHit`.

### Applying Forces

```cpp
// On a simulated physics body
Mesh->AddForce(FVector::ForwardVector * Strength);
Mesh->AddImpulse(FVector::UpVector * ImpulseStrength);
Mesh->AddTorqueInRadians(FVector::UpVector * Torque);

// On a Character
Character->LaunchCharacter(FVector::UpVector * JumpHeight, false, false);
```

### Common Pitfall

Collision/overlap events fire only if BOTH objects have `GenerateOverlapEvents` or collision enabled. If one object has collision disabled, no events fire.

### Line Trace / Raycast

UE's equivalent of Unity's `Physics.Raycast`. Fire a line into the world and get what it hits.

**C++ — single line trace:**

```cpp
FHitResult Hit;
FVector Start = GetActorLocation();
FVector End = Start + GetActorForwardVector() * 1000.0f; // 10 meters forward

FCollisionQueryParams Params;
Params.AddIgnoredActor(this); // don't hit yourself

bool bHit = GetWorld()->LineTraceSingleByChannel(
    Hit, Start, End, ECC_Visibility, Params);

if (bHit)
{
    AActor* HitActor = Hit.GetActor();
    FVector ImpactPoint = Hit.ImpactPoint;
    float Distance = Hit.Distance;
}
```

**Trace by object type** (more specific):
```cpp
FCollisionObjectQueryParams ObjParams;
ObjParams.AddObjectTypesToQuery(ECC_Pawn); // only hit pawns
GetWorld()->LineTraceSingleByObjectType(Hit, Start, End, ObjParams, Params);
```

**Multi-line trace** (hit all objects along the line):
```cpp
TArray<FHitResult> Hits;
GetWorld()->LineTraceMultiByChannel(Hits, Start, End, ECC_Visibility, Params);
```

**Shape traces** (sphere, box, capsule):
```cpp
// Sphere sweep (like a thick line trace)
GetWorld()->SweepSingleByChannel(Hit, Start, End, FQuat::Identity,
    ECC_Visibility, FCollisionShape::MakeSphere(50.0f), Params);

// Box sweep
GetWorld()->SweepSingleByChannel(Hit, Start, End, FQuat::Identity,
    ECC_Visibility, FCollisionShape::MakeBox(FVector(10, 10, 10)), Params);
```

**Blueprint:**

| Node | Use |
|---|---|
| **Line Trace By Channel** | Single trace, stops at first hit. Most common. |
| **Line Trace By Object Type** | Filter by specific object types (Pawn, WorldDynamic, etc.) |
| **Multi Line Trace By Channel** | Hits everything along the line, returns array |
| **Sphere Trace / Box Trace** | Shape traces (like thick lines) |

All trace nodes have a `Draw Debug Type` pin — set to `For One Frame` or `For Duration` to visualize the trace during development.

### Common Collision Channels

| Channel | Used For |
|---|---|
| `ECC_Visibility` | Line of sight, general purpose raycast |
| `ECC_Camera` | Camera collision, third-person camera |
| `ECC_Pawn` | Pawn/character collision |
| `ECC_WorldStatic` | Static meshes, walls, floors |
| `ECC_WorldDynamic` | Movable objects |
| `ECC_PhysicsBody` | Simulated physics bodies |
| Custom channels | Define in Project Settings → Collision |

### Trace Pitfalls

- **No hit at all** → check collision channel. If target uses `ECC_WorldStatic` but you trace `ECC_Visibility`, it won't hit.
- **Self-hit** → add `Params.AddIgnoredActor(this)` or disable `Trace Complex` in collision settings.
- **Hits behind you** → check that Start/End are correct. `GetActorForwardVector()` returns a unit vector — multiply by distance.
- **Blueprint `Draw Debug Type`** → set to `None` in shipping builds, or use `#if WITH_EDITOR` in C++.

### SweepMultiByObjectType vs SweepMultiByChannel

**`SweepMultiByChannel`** — filters by channel RESPONSE. If Pawn→Pawn is Overlap, won't detect other Pawns.
**`SweepMultiByObjectType`** — filters by object TYPE. Detects all objects of specified type(s) regardless of response. Preferred for combat traces:

```cpp
FCollisionObjectQueryParams ObjParams;
ObjParams.AddObjectTypesToQuery(ECC_Pawn);
GetWorld()->SweepMultiByObjectType(Hits, Start, End, FQuat::Identity, ObjParams, Shape, Params);
```

**Tag-based target identification:**
```cpp
Tags.Add(FName("Player"));  // in player's BeginPlay
if (HitActor->ActorHasTag(FName("Player"))) { /* apply damage */ }  // in enemy's attack trace
```

---

## Animation

### Animation Blueprint (ABP)

State machine-based system. Uses an **AnimGraph** (pose output) + **EventGraph** (per-frame logic).

- **State Machine** — transitions between states (Idle → Walk → Run) based on variables
- **Blend Space** — blends animations based on 1D or 2D parameters (e.g., speed + direction)
- **Animation Montage** — sequenced animation clips for attacks, interactions, combos
- **Aim Offset** — additive pose blending for weapon aiming
- **Control Rig** — procedural animation authoring and IK

### Key Variables

```cpp
// In Character class, update per Tick:
float Speed = GetVelocity().Size();
bool bIsInAir = GetCharacterMovement()->IsFalling();
```

Then in Animation Blueprint, read these variables to drive state transitions.

### Skeleton Animation Events

**Blueprint (in AnimGraph):** Add `AnimNotify` to timeline → fires event on the owning Actor.

### AnimNotify Architecture

AnimNotifies are `UAnimNotify` subclasses placed on montage timelines — they bridge animation to gameplay code:

```cpp
UCLASS()
class UAnimNotify_DoAttackTrace : public UAnimNotify
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    virtual void Notify(USkeletalMeshComponent* MeshComp, UAnimSequenceBase* Animation,
        const FAnimNotifyEventReference& EventReference) override;
};

// In .cpp: Cast owner to interface → call gameplay method
void UAnimNotify_DoAttackTrace::Notify(...) {
    if (ICombatAttacker* Attacker = Cast<ICombatAttacker>(MeshComp->GetOwner()))
        Attacker->DoAttackTrace(AttackBoneName);
}
```

**Common combat Notifies:** `DoAttackTrace`, `CheckCombo`, `CheckChargedAttack`, `EndDash`.

**Placement:** Open montage → Notifies track → right-click → Add Notify → select class → position on timeline.

### Common Pitfall

Forgetting to set `Mesh->SetAnimationMode(EAnimationMode::AnimationBlueprint)` or assign the AnimBP in the Character Blueprint → character is in T-pose.

### Compatible Skeleton Retargeting

When IK Rig Retarget fails in UE5.8 (Mixamo FBX: no Humanoid dropdown, IK Rig preview skeleton won't resolve):
1. Open target Skeleton → Skeleton Tree → right-click → **Manage Compatible Skeletons**
2. Add source skeleton → all its animations auto-retarget at runtime
3. Works for UE4→UE5 Mannequin, Animation Starter Pack (62 animations). Not for radically different skeletons.

### ABP Creation & Troubleshooting

**Creating a proper Animation Blueprint:**
- Content Browser → right-click → Animation → **Animation Blueprint** → parent class `AnimInstance` → target Skeleton.
- Do **NOT** use `create_blueprint` with `parent_class="AnimInstance"` — the MCP and generic Blueprint factory create a regular `UBlueprint`, which lacks the **AnimGraph** tab.
- To verify: a correct AnimBP has `Event Graph | Anim Graph` tabs. A regular BP has `Event Graph | Construction Script | Viewport`.

**Copying between Animation Blueprints:**
- AnimGraph and Event Graph from one ABP can be copy-pasted (`Ctrl+A` → `Ctrl+C` → `Ctrl+V`) into another ABP **with the same skeleton**.
- After Paste: **Compile immediately**. Missing variables from the source ABP will cause errors — check `My Blueprint → Variables` and recreate any that failed to copy (e.g., `GroundSpeed`, `Direction`, `ShouldMove`, `IsFalling`).
- Common cached references in ABP: `Character` (Object Reference), `Movement Component` (Character Movement Component). These must exist as local variables for the copied Event Graph to compile.

**Event Graph Variable Update Chain (standard pattern):**
```
Event Blueprint Update Animation
  → Sequence
    → Try Get Pawn Owner → Cast to Character → SET Character (cache)
    → Get Character → Get Character Movement → SET Movement Component
    → Get Movement Component → Get Velocity → Vector Length → SET GroundSpeed
    → Get Movement Component → Get Current Acceleration → ... → SET Direction
    ... → Get Is Crouched → SET Is Crouched     (custom crouch chain)
```
All `SET` nodes are on the Sequence execution chain. `Get` nodes are pure functions (no exec pins), connected by data lines to their targets.

**C++ BlueprintPure for AnimBP access:** See §Advanced Gameplay Patterns → C++ BlueprintPure for Animation Blueprint Access for full example with multi-function pattern and ABP Event Graph flow.

## Timelines

UE's visual animation curve editor. Create bezier/linear/key curves for float, vector, color, or other values over time — usable from Blueprint without C++.

**Create:** Content Browser → right-click → Miscellaneous → **Timeline**. Or inside any Blueprint Event Graph, right-click → `Add Timeline`.

**Structure:**
- **Track** — drives one value type (Float, Vector, Color, Event). A timeline can have multiple tracks.
- **Keyframe** — a point in time + value. Connect keyframes with curves.
- **Play / Reverse / Stop** — timeline control nodes.
- **Update** — output fires every frame while the timeline is playing.
- **Finished** — output fires when the timeline reaches the end.

**Common uses:**
- Smooth door/lift movement (Vector track driving `SetActorLocation`)
- UI fade in/out (Float track driving opacity)
- Camera fade to black (Float track driving a post-process parameter)
- Timed events (Event track firing sound effects at specific moments)

**Timeline vs Timer vs Tick:**

| | Timeline | Timer | Tick |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Curve-driven values** | ✅ Native | Requires manual lerp | Manual per-frame |
| **Precision** | Curve-precise | Delta-based | Frame-dependent |
| **Blueprint-friendly** | ✅ Visual editor | ✅ Nodes | ✅ Event node |
| **Overhead** | Medium | Low | Per-frame cost |
| **Use for** | Smooth animations, fading | Delayed/repeating logic | Continuous gameplay |

## Character Movement

`ACharacter` comes with a built-in **CharacterMovementComponent** (CMC). It handles walking, jumping, falling, swimming, flying — and syncs with Animation Blueprints automatically.

### Key Properties

| Property | What It Controls |
|---|---|
| `MaxWalkSpeed` | Top speed while walking (600 default) |
| `JumpZVelocity` | Vertical launch speed for jumps (420 default) |
| `AirControl` | How much the player can steer in mid-air (0.05 default, low) |
| `GravityScale` | Gravity multiplier (1.0 = normal) |
| `MaxAcceleration` | How fast speed ramps up |
| `BrakingDecelerationWalking` | How fast speed drops when no input |
| `bWantsToCrouch` | Request crouch (character resizes capsule) |

### Movement Modes

CMC has a `MovementMode` enum that determines how the character moves:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `MOVE_Walking` | On ground, affected by slopes |
| `MOVE_Falling` | In air, gravity applies |
| `MOVE_Flying` | Free 3D movement, no gravity |
| `MOVE_Swimming` | Underwater, buoyancy |
| `MOVE_NavWalking` | AI navigation on navmesh |
| `MOVE_Custom` | Override with custom movement logic (dash, wall-run, grapple) |

### Common Operations

```cpp
UCharacterMovementComponent* CMC = GetCharacterMovement();

// Jump
void AMyCharacter::OnJump()
{
    if (GetCharacterMovement()->IsMovingOnGround())
    {
        Jump();  // inherited from ACharacter, uses JumpZVelocity
    }
}

// Sprint
void AMyCharacter::OnSprintStart()  { CMC->MaxWalkSpeed = 1200.0f; }
void AMyCharacter::OnSprintEnd()    { CMC->MaxWalkSpeed = 600.0f; }

// Crouch
void AMyCharacter::OnCrouch()
{
    if (CMC->IsMovingOnGround())
    {
        Crouch();  // halves capsule height, adjusts camera
    }
}
```

**Blueprint:** `Get Character Movement` node → drag off to set properties or call `Jump`/`Crouch`/`StopJumping`.

### Movement Input

CMC reads movement input automatically when you call:

```cpp
void AMyCharacter::OnMove(const FInputActionValue& Value)
{
    FVector2D Input = Value.Get<FVector2D>();
    AddMovementInput(GetActorForwardVector(), Input.Y);   // W/S
    AddMovementInput(GetActorRightVector(), Input.X);     // A/D
}
```

CMC handles acceleration, friction, and slope limits from this raw input — no manual velocity math needed.

### Animation Integration

CMC exposes several variables that ABPs read directly:
- `GetVelocity().Size()` → speed → drives Walk/Run/Idle blends
- `IsFalling()` → jump/fall state
- `IsCrouching()` → crouch state
- `GetCurrentAcceleration()` → movement input direction → Blend Space parameter

### Common Pitfalls

- Calling `Jump()` when already in air → ignored. Check `IsMovingOnGround()` first.
- Modifying `MaxWalkSpeed` in Tick without caching CMC → constant GetComponent overhead.
- Changing `MaxWalkSpeed` directly on the MovementComponent, NOT on the Character — `Character->MaxWalkSpeed` is a deprecated wrapper.
- The `Crouch()`/`UnCrouch()` methods are on `ACharacter`, not on CMC.
- Directly setting `CMC->Velocity` in Tick → overridden next frame by CMC. Use `AddMovementInput()` or `LaunchCharacter()` instead.

### Crouch Setup

```cpp
// Constructor
GetCharacterMovement()->GetNavAgentPropertiesRef().bCanCrouch = true;
GetCharacterMovement()->SetCrouchedHalfHeight(48.f);  // use setter, not deprecated public member
```

Animation side (ABP): `Try Get Pawn Owner` → `Cast to YourCharacter` → `Get Is Crouched` → drive state machine or Blend Poses by Bool. Engine Manny crouch animations at `/Engine/Characters/Mannequins/Animations/Unarmed/Crouch/` (enable Show Engine Content).

### State Bitfields

Combine multiple gameplay states into one byte:
```cpp
uint8 bHasWallJumped : 1;
uint8 bHasDoubleJumped : 1;
uint8 bHasDashed : 1;
uint8 bIsDashing : 1;
uint8 bIsAttacking : 1;
uint8 bIsChargingAttack : 1;
```
Reset flags on landing: `Landed()` → zero out movement-specific flags.

---

## StateTree AI (UE5 Default)

UE5 game templates use **StateTree** for NPC behavior (not legacy Behavior Trees):

```
NPC's UStateTreeComponent → StateTree asset
  → Evaluators: check conditions (distance, HP, line-of-sight)
  → Tasks: execute actions (move, attack, evade)
```

**Key classes:** `AAIController` bridges StateTree and Navigation System. `UStateTree` asset defines behavior.

**Troubleshooting:** "Context Requirements failed" on PIE stop = benign. NPC freeze → press P to check NavMesh. NPC won't attack → verify target Tag/collision channel.

---

## UMG (UI)

UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) is the Widget Blueprint system — UE's equivalent of uGUI.

### Widget Blueprint

Create in Content Browser → right-click → User Interface → Widget Blueprint. Use the **Designer** tab to arrange UI elements visually, and the **Graph** tab for logic.

### Common Widgets

| Widget | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Button | Clickable element with OnClicked event |
| Text Block | Display text |
| Image | Show texture/material |
| Progress Bar | Fill bar (health, loading) |
| Canvas Panel | Arbitrary pixel positioning |
| Horizontal/Vertical Box | Automatic layout |
| Overlay | Layered stacking |

### Creating and Showing UI

```cpp
// C++ — create widget and add to viewport
UUserWidget* Widget = CreateWidget<UUserWidget>(GetWorld(), WidgetClass);
Widget->AddToViewport();

// Remove
Widget->RemoveFromParent();
```

**Blueprint:** `Create Widget` → `Add to Viewport` nodes.

### Data Binding

UE5 supports property binding: Widget text/value → function or property → updates automatically. Set in the Designer, next to each property dropdown.

### CommonUI (UE 5.1+)

A cross-platform UI framework for controller/keyboard/touch navigation. Handles focus management, button styles per platform, and input mode switching automatically.

### WidgetComponent (3D World Widgets)

`UWidgetComponent` attaches a UMG widget to an Actor in the 3D world (health bars, nameplates):

```cpp
WComp->SetWidgetClass(WidgetClass);
WComp->InitWidget();                              // force immediate creation
WComp->SetRelativeLocation(FVector(0,0,120));     // above character head
WComp->SetDrawSize(FVector2D(150, 20));           // render resolution
WComp->SetTwoSided(true);
```

**Screen space** (`EWidgetSpace::Screen`): rendered above scene, always visible, **must call `RequestRedraw()`** after property changes (RenderTarget cache).

**World space** (`EWidgetSpace::World`): rendered in 3D world, participates in depth test (occluded behind geometry), auto-refreshes.

**Updating widget values from C++:**
```cpp
// Bypass BP event, directly access child widget by name
UProgressBar* PB = Cast<UProgressBar>(Widget->GetWidgetFromName(TEXT("Bar")));
if (PB) PB->SetPercent(0.75f);
WComp->RequestRedraw();  // required for Screen space
```
Widget name is found in the Widget BP Designer → Hierarchy panel.

---

## Audio

### Audio Components

- **AudioComponent** — plays SoundCues/SoundWaves, supports spatial 3D audio, looping, fading
- Add to any Actor via `UAudioComponent`

### Playing Sounds

```cpp
// One-shot (no component needed)
UGameplayStatics::PlaySound2D(GetWorld(), SoundCueAsset);
UGameplayStatics::PlaySoundAtLocation(GetWorld(), SoundCueAsset, Location);

// On an AudioComponent
AudioComp->SetSound(SoundCueAsset);
AudioComp->Play();
AudioComp->FadeIn(2.0f);
```

**Blueprint:** `Play Sound 2D` / `Play Sound at Location` nodes.

### MetaSounds (UE5)

MetaSounds is a procedural, programmable audio system — like a Material Editor for audio. Graph-based, data-driven, supports runtime parameter changes.

### Sound Cues

Traditional node-based audio logic (randomization, attenuation, modulation). Still supported alongside MetaSounds.

---

## Niagara (VFX)

Niagara is UE5's particle and visual effects system (replacing Cascade from UE4). It uses a modular, stack-based approach — each emitter is a pipeline of reorderable modules.

### System vs Emitter

| Level | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Niagara System** | Top-level asset you place in the level. Contains one or more Emitters. The System handles shared parameters, timings, and world interaction. |
| **Emitter** | One particle emitter inside a System. Each emitter has its own spawn rate, lifetime, modules, and renderer. You can stack multiple emitters (fire trail + smoke burst + sparks). |

### Core Modules (Emitter Pipeline)

Each emitter processes particles through a fixed-order pipeline:

| Module | Function |
|---|---|
| **Emitter State** | Emitter lifecycle: active/inactive, loops, duration |
| **Spawn Rate / Spawn Burst** | How many particles per second, or a one-time burst count |
| **Particle Spawn** | Initialize each new particle: position, velocity, color, size, lifetime |
| **Particle Update** | Per-frame updates: velocity, forces, color-over-life, size-over-life, drag |
| **Render** | How particles look: sprite, mesh, ribbon, light, volume |

### Common Operations

**Change particle count:**
- Select Emitter → **Spawn Rate** module → drag `SpawnRate` value higher/lower
- For instant burst: add **Spawn Burst Instantaneous** module in Particle Spawn

**Change particle lifetime:**
- Emitter → **Particle Spawn** → `Initialize Particle` → modify `Lifetime` range

**Change particle size / color:**
- **Particle Update** → `Scale Color` or `Scale Sprite Size` → set curve/constant over particle life

**Add gravity / wind:**
- **Particle Update** → `Add Velocity` or `Curl Noise Force` → adjust strength

**GPU vs CPU emitters:**
- Select Emitter → `Properties` → `Sim Target`: `CPUSim` (features + collision) or `GPUComputeSim` (massive counts, limited features)

### Opening a Niagara System

Double-click any Niagara asset in the Content Browser, or drag one into a level → right-click Actor → `Edit Niagara System`.

### Lightweight Emitters (UE 5.4+)

Stateless emitters for simple VFX (sparkles, dust motes, UI particles). No per-frame state stored — lower overhead, but no collision support. Good for ambient effects with high emitter counts.

### Niagara Data Channels (UE 5.5+)

Pass data between different Niagara Systems (e.g., a footstep system tells a dust system exactly where to spawn). Also used to inject gameplay events into shared VFX pools for better performance.

### Heterogeneous Volumes (UE 5.5+, Beta)

Import VDB volumetric data (smoke, explosions) into Niagara and render as Sparse Volume Textures. Supports self-shadowing and overlapping volumes.

### Choosing Niagara vs Blueprint Spawned VFX

| Scenario | Use |
|---|---|
| Continuous ambient effects (dust, fog, rain) | Niagara with Lightweight Emitters |
| Complex particle behavior (curves, forces, burst) | Niagara CPU/GPU emitter |
| Simple one-shot effects (muzzle flash) | Spawn a Niagara System Actor via Blueprint |
| Logic-driven VFX (boss spawn, cutscene) | Trigger Niagara activation from Blueprint event |

---

## Enhanced Input

UE5's modern input system (replaces legacy Axis/Action mappings from UE4).

### Core Concepts

| Asset | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Input Action** | Abstract action: "Jump", "Fire", "Move" |
| **Input Mapping Context** | Maps keys/buttons to Input Actions |
| **Input Modifier** | Post-processes raw input (negate, dead zone, scalar) |
| **Input Trigger** | Determines when action fires (pressed, held, released, tapped) |

### Setup Workflow

1. Create **Input Actions** in `Content/Input/Actions/`
2. Create **Input Mapping Context** in `Content/Input/`
3. In Character Blueprint → `Event BeginPlay` → `Get Player Controller` → `Enhanced Input Local Player Subsystem` → `Add Mapping Context`
4. Bind Input Actions to your logic via `Enhanced Input Action Event` nodes

### C++ Binding

```cpp
// Setup
void AMyCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
    Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);

    if (UEnhancedInputComponent* EnhancedInput = Cast<UEnhancedInputComponent>(PlayerInputComponent))
    {
        EnhancedInput->BindAction(MoveAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &AMyCharacter::OnMove);
        EnhancedInput->BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Started, this, &AMyCharacter::OnJump);
    }
}

void AMyCharacter::OnMove(const FInputActionValue& Value)
{
    FVector2D MovementVector = Value.Get<FVector2D>();
    AddMovementInput(GetActorForwardVector(), MovementVector.Y);
    AddMovementInput(GetActorRightVector(), MovementVector.X);
}
```

### Common Pitfall

Forgetting to add the Input Mapping Context in BeginPlay → Enhanced Input does nothing silently. Also, ensure `EnhancedInput` plugin is enabled in `.uproject`.

### Multi-IMC Loading

Load multiple IMCs in the PlayerController:

```cpp
if (UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem* Sub = ULocalPlayer::GetSubsystem<UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem>(GetLocalPlayer()))
{
    Sub->AddMappingContext(IMC_Default, 0);    // WASD + mouse
    Sub->AddMappingContext(IMC_MouseLook, 0);  // mouse camera control
    Sub->AddMappingContext(IMC_Gameplay, 0);   // combat/jump/dash
}
```

If ConstructorHelpers fails (IMC array empty), fallback in `BeginPlay`:
```cpp
UInputMappingContext* IMC = LoadObject<UInputMappingContext>(nullptr, TEXT("/Game/Input/IMC_Fused.IMC_Fused"));
if (IMC) DefaultMappingContexts.Add(IMC);
```

### Trigger Events

| ETriggerEvent | When |
|---|---|
| `Started` | Input becomes non-zero (press) |
| `Ongoing` | Every tick while held |
| `Triggered` | Thresholds met (hold time, tap) |
| `Completed` | Input returns to zero (release) |
| `Canceled` | Interrupted before completion |

**Typical bindings:**
```cpp
BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Started, this, &ACharacter::Jump);
BindAction(JumpAction, ETriggerEvent::Completed, this, &ACharacter::StopJumping);
BindAction(CrouchAction, ETriggerEvent::Started, this, &AMyChar::ToggleCrouch);
```

**Note:** Some UE versions merge identical InputAction Mappings into one row. Use multiple Triggers within a single row as workaround.

### Interface Calling Convention

When a `UINTERFACE` uses `MinimalAPI` + `NotBlueprintable`:
```cpp
UINTERFACE(MinimalAPI, NotBlueprintable)
class UCombatDamageable : public UInterface { ... };
```
UHT does **NOT** generate `Execute_` helpers. Call directly:
```cpp
if (ICombatDamageable* Dmg = Cast<ICombatDamageable>(HitActor))
    Dmg->ApplyDamage(...); // correct
// NOT: ICombatDamageable::Execute_ApplyDamage(...) — won't compile
```

`Execute_` is only generated for `BlueprintImplementableEvent`/`BlueprintNativeEvent` on Blueprint-exposed UINTERFACEs. Always check the interface header first.

---

## Network Replication

UE has built-in client-server networking. The server is authoritative; clients send inputs, server runs logic, state syncs back.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Authoritative. Runs GameMode, executes gameplay logic. |
| **Client** | Owns one PlayerController + Pawn. Sends input, receives state. |
| **Listen Server** | One player is both server AND client. |
| **Dedicated Server** | Server with no local player — purely authoritative. |
| **Replication** | Server sends property/actor state to clients. |

### Property Replication

```cpp
UPROPERTY(Replicated)
float Health;

UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing = OnRep_Ammo)
int32 Ammo;

UFUNCTION()
void OnRep_Ammo();  // Called on clients when Ammo changes on server

// Must override in .cpp:
void AMyCharacter::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const
{
    Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(OutLifetimeProps);
    DOREPLIFETIME(AMyCharacter, Health);
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION(AMyCharacter, Ammo, COND_OwnerOnly); // only to owning client
}
```

### RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)

```cpp
UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable)     // Called from client → executes on server
void ServerFire();

UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable)     // Called from server → executes on owning client
void ClientShowDamage(float Amount);

UFUNCTION(NetMulticast, Reliable)  // Called from server → executes on ALL clients
void MulticastPlayExplosion(FVector Location);

// Implementation:
void AMyCharacter::ServerFire_Implementation()
{
    // This runs on the server
    MulticastPlayExplosion(GetActorLocation());
}

bool AMyCharacter::ServerFire_Validate() { return true; } // optional validation
```

### Authority Check Pattern

```cpp
// Only run on server
if (HasAuthority())
{
    // Apply damage, spawn items, etc.
}

// Only run on owning client
if (IsLocallyControlled())
{
    // Show local UI, play local effects
}
```

**Blueprint:** `Switch Has Authority` node.

### Common Pitfall

- RPCs must be called from the correct side (Server RPC → called only on client). Calling a Server RPC from the server → ignored.
- Forget to add `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps` → properties don't replicate, no warning.
- Replicated properties only sync server→client. Clients never modify replicated properties directly — use Server RPCs to request server state changes.

---

## GameInstance

Created on game start, persists across ALL level transitions. Destroyed only on game quit.

### What Goes in GameInstance

- Persistent managers (save system, settings, achievement tracking)
- Cross-level data (selected character, difficulty)
- Score/campaign state that survives death
- Online session management

### Accessing GameInstance

```cpp
UGameInstance* GI = GetGameInstance();
UMyGameInstance* MyGI = Cast<UMyGameInstance>(GI);
if (MyGI) { MyGI->PlayerScore = 100; }
```

**Blueprint:** `Get Game Instance` node → cast to your custom GameInstance class.

## SaveGame (USaveGame)

UE's serialization system for saving/loading player progress:

```cpp
// MySaveGame.h — define save data
UCLASS()
class UMySaveGame : public USaveGame
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UPROPERTY()
    float PlayerHealth;

    UPROPERTY()
    int32 Level;

    UPROPERTY()
    FVector PlayerPosition;

    UPROPERTY()
    TArray<FString> CompletedQuests;
};

// Save
UMySaveGame* SaveGameInstance = Cast<UMySaveGame>(
    UGameplayStatics::CreateSaveGameObject(UMySaveGame::StaticClass()));
SaveGameInstance->PlayerHealth = 100.0f;
UGameplayStatics::SaveGameToSlot(SaveGameInstance, TEXT("Slot1"), 0);

// Load
UMySaveGame* LoadedGame = Cast<UMySaveGame>(
    UGameplayStatics::LoadGameFromSlot(TEXT("Slot1"), 0));
if (LoadedGame)
    Health = LoadedGame->PlayerHealth;

// Check if save exists
if (UGameplayStatics::DoesSaveGameExist(TEXT("Slot1"), 0)) { }

// Delete save
UGameplayStatics::DeleteGameInSlot(TEXT("Slot1"), 0);
```

**Blueprint:** `Save Game to Slot` / `Load Game from Slot` nodes.

**Common pattern:** Autosave on level transition, manual save at checkpoints, load on game start in GameInstance.

## Subsystems

The modern replacement for Singletons in UE5. Managed by the engine, auto-instantiated:

| Subsystem Type | Lifetime | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **UGameInstanceSubsystem** | Entire game session | SaveManager, AchievementTracker |
| **UWorldSubsystem** | Per level/map | SpawnManager, Weather, QuestTracker |
| **ULocalPlayerSubsystem** | Per local player | Input binding, UI state manager |
| **UEditorSubsystem** | Editor only | Editor tools, automation |

```cpp
// MyWorldSubsystem.h
UCLASS()
class UMyWorldSubsystem : public UWorldSubsystem
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    virtual void Initialize(FSubsystemCollectionBase& Collection) override;
    virtual void Deinitialize() override;
    void SpawnWave(int32 Count);
};

// Usage from anywhere:
UMyWorldSubsystem* Sub = GetWorld()->GetSubsystem<UMyWorldSubsystem>();
if (Sub) Sub->SpawnWave(10);
```

Subsystems are auto-discovered — no registration, no Singleton pattern. Use them instead of static managers.

---

## Data Assets (UDataAsset / UPrimaryDataAsset)

Similar to Unity's ScriptableObject — data containers that live as project assets, not scene objects.

```cpp
UCLASS(BlueprintType)
class UWeaponData : public UDataAsset
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    FString WeaponName;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    float Damage;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UTexture2D* Icon;
};
```

Create in Content Browser → right-click → Miscellaneous → Data Asset → select your class.

Great for weapon stats, enemy configs, item databases, dialogue trees.

### DataTables

For tabular data — rows of entries with the same columns. Like a spreadsheet:

1. Create a struct: `USTRUCT(BlueprintType) struct FWeaponRow : public FTableRowBase { ... };`
2. Create DataTable asset → set row struct to `FWeaponRow`
3. Fill rows in the editor (CSV import supported)

```cpp
// Lookup by row name
FWeaponRow* Row = DataTable->FindRow<FWeaponRow>(FName("Shotgun"), TEXT(""));
if (Row) float Damage = Row->Damage;
```

**Blueprint:** `Get Data Table Row` node → pick row by name → break struct.

**DataAsset vs DataTable:**

| | DataAsset | DataTable |
|---|---|---|
| One entry per asset | ✅ | ❌ |
| Tabular/mass data | ❌ | ✅ |
| CSV import | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use for | Unique configs | Item databases |

### GameplayTags

Hierarchical labels for categorizing and querying: `Enemy.Melee.Goblin`, `State.Dead`, `Ability.Cooldown`.

```cpp
// Match with hierarchy (O(1)) — Enemy.Melee.Goblin matches "Enemy"
if (Actor->HasMatchingGameplayTag(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Enemy"))) { }

// Request once, reuse
FGameplayTag DeadTag = FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("State.Dead");
```

**Blueprint:** `Has Matching Gameplay Tag` node. Enable the `GameplayTags` plugin.

Use tags instead of string/enum-based state checks for: damage types, character state, ability categories, UI filters.

### Soft References (TSoftObjectPtr)

Defer loading large assets — critical for memory and load times:

```cpp
// Hard reference — loads immediately, stays in memory
UPROPERTY() UTexture2D* Icon;

// Soft reference — paths only, loads on demand
UPROPERTY() TSoftObjectPtr<UTexture2D> IconSoft;
IconSoft.LoadSynchronous(); // blocking load (small assets OK)
// For large: use FStreamableManager::RequestAsyncLoad()
```

**Blueprint:** `Soft Object Reference` variable → `Async Load Asset` node → use result on success pin.

---

## Gameplay Ability System (Overview)

GAS is UE's built-in framework for abilities, attributes, buffs, and cooldowns. Used by games like Fortnite, ARK, Borderlands.

### When to Use
- RPGs, MOBAs, hero shooters with many abilities/buffs
- Complex attribute systems (health + shield + armor + modifiers)
- Cooldown management, ability costs (mana, stamina)

### When NOT to Use
- Simple games with few mechanics
- Prototyping phase (adds significant complexity)
- Teams without a programmer comfortable with GAS

### Key Modules
- `AbilitySystemComponent` — attaches to Pawn/Character, manages abilities
- `GameplayAbility` — one ability (fire, jump, heal)
- `GameplayEffect` — modifier (damage, buff, debuff, heal)
- `GameplayTag` — hierarchical labels for categorization

GAS is fully exposed to Blueprint. Enabling the `GameplayAbilities` plugin activates it.

---

## Performance Best Practices

### C++ Performance
- Avoid `GetAllActorsOfClass()` in Tick — cache or use a manager
- Prefer `TArray` over `std::vector` — UE's allocator is optimized
- Use `FString` for text, `FName` for identifiers (interned, fast comparison), `FText` for localized display
- Avoid `LoadObject` at runtime — use `TSoftObjectPtr` for async loading

### Blueprint Performance
- Blueprint `Tick` is slower than C++ `Tick` — move heavy work to C++
- Avoid casting on Tick — cache the cast result
- Use `Sequence` instead of many function calls with output pins when data doesn't depend on order

### Rendering
- Enable Nanite on high-poly static meshes
- Use LODs for skeletal meshes and non-Nanite geometry
- Limit dynamic shadow-casting lights
- Use Light Function Atlas (UE 5.5+) to reduce light function cost
- Profile with `stat gpu`, `stat unit`, `stat scenerendering`

### Physics
- Use simple collision shapes (box, sphere, capsule) over complex mesh collision
- Disable physics simulation on objects that don't need it
- Limit the number of simulated bodies — Chaos is cheaper than PhysX but still not free

## Packaging & Shipping

### Build Configuration

`Project Settings → Packaging` or **Platforms → Windows → Package Project**.

**Key settings:**
- **Build Configuration:** `Development` (debug info, logs) or `Shipping` (optimized, no console, for release)
- **Full Rebuild:** Recompiles everything — use when things break mysteriously
- **Cook only maps in list:** cooks only levels in Project Settings → Maps list (saves time)

### Package Folder

Output goes to project root's `Windows/` folder (or corresponding platform). The `.exe` requires all adjacent DLLs and the `Content/Paks/` folder — distribute the entire output directory.

### Shipping Build Checklist

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Set `bIsShipping = true` in `.Target.cs` | Removes debug code, editor-only features |
| Disable `Draw Debug` trace/print | `DrawDebugLine` doesn't compile in Shipping |
| Remove console commands | `stat fps`, `stat unit` not available in Shipping |
| Test on target hardware | Editor ≠ standalone build. GPU/CPU profiles differ. |
| Package Content Compression | Project Settings → Packaging → Enable Pak compression |
| Check asset references | Any missing assets become invisible (no error) |
| Test with `-game` flag | Launch `.exe -game -log` for debug output |

### Cross-Platform

| Platform | Additional Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | None — out of the box |
| **Mac** | Requires Mac with Xcode (can't cross-compile from Windows) |
| **Linux** | Cross-compile toolchain or build on Linux |
| **Android** | Android SDK + NDK + device for testing |
| **iOS** | Mac + Xcode + Apple Developer account |

### Patch & DLC

Use **Patching** in Project Settings → Packaging for delta updates. Content-only patches can be smaller than a full rebuild. External Data Layers + Game Features plugins support DLC without touching base game content.

## MCP Integration (UE5.5+)

The Model Context Protocol enables AI assistants to control Unreal Editor through natural language. Two implementations exist: the official UE5 built-in plugin and the community-driven chongdashu/unreal-mcp.

### Official vs Community MCP

| | Official (Built-in) | Community (chongdashu/unreal-mcp) |
|---|---|---|
| **Activation** | Edit → Plugins → Enable "ModelContextProtocol" | Copy `Plugins/UnrealMCP/` to project + build |
| **Port** | HTTP :8000 | TCP :55557 (C++ plugin) + Python bridge |
| **Tool Count** | ~4 (AgentSkill only) | ~30 (Actor, Blueprint, UMG, Editor, Input) |
| **Python Setup** | None | `uv` venv with `fastmcp`, `mcp[cli]` |

### Community MCP Deployment (opencode)

1. **Plugin**: Clone repo → copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/` to project `Plugins/`
2. **Build**: Close editor → `Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat ProjectEditor Win64 Development -Project="path.uproject" -WaitMutex`
3. **Python**: `uv venv` in `Plugins/UnrealMCP/Python/` → `uv pip install -e .`
4. **opencode config** (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):
```json
"mcp": {
  "unrealMCP": {
    "type": "local",
    "command": ["uv.exe", "--directory", "<path>/Python", "run", "unreal_mcp_server.py"]
  }
}
```

### UE5.8 Compatibility Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ANY_PACKAGE` undeclared (removed in 5.8) | Replace with `nullptr` in `FindObject<UClass>(nullptr, ...)` |
| `BufferSize` shadows engine `StringConv.h` | Rename local `BufferSize` → `MCPSocketBufferSize` |
| `add_component_to_blueprint` fails for `StaticMeshComponent` | Known limitation — `FindObject<UClass>` can't resolve at MCP call time |
| StaticMesh not assignable to spawned Actor via `set_actor_property` | MCP only sets Actor-level properties, not component sub-properties |

### MCP Limitations

- **No Animation Blueprint support**: `find_blueprint_nodes` / `add_blueprint_variable` only work on regular Blueprints, not AnimBPs.
- **No asset deletion**: `delete_actor` only removes level actors, not Content Browser assets.
- **Static mesh assignment**: `set_static_mesh_properties` only works on Blueprint CDOs, not spawned actors.
- **UE Editor must be running**: Python bridge connects to the C++ plugin's TCP server inside the editor process.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Shader Compilation Stuck or Crashing

Symptom: Editor freezes with "Compiling Shaders (XXXX remaining)" or crashes on launch.

- **Wait it out** — first launch after engine/project update compiles thousands of shaders. Can take 10-30 minutes.
- **Out of VRAM** — integrated GPUs (Intel Arc, AMD APU) may run out of VRAM during shader compilation. Lower in-engine quality to Medium: Settings → Engine Scalability → Medium.
- **Driver update** — update your GPU driver to the latest version.
- **Nuke shader cache**: Delete `DerivedDataCache/` and `Intermediate/` in both project folder and engine install, then restart.

### EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION

Most common crash. Null pointer dereference — you accessed an Actor/Component that doesn't exist.

- Check if `GetWorld()`, `GetOwner()`, `FindComponentByClass<T>()` returned `nullptr` before use.
- In Blueprint: use `IsValid?` node before accessing object references.
- Character falling out of world → set `World Settings → Kill Z` to remove and respawn below a threshold instead of crashing.

### Project Won't Open / Version Mismatch

- Right-click `.uproject` → **Switch Unreal Engine Version** → pick installed version.
- If engine not listed: launch Epic Games Launcher → Unreal Engine tab → Library → install matching version.
- Corrupted project: delete `Intermediate/` and `Saved/` folders → reopen.
- "Modules are missing or built with a different engine version" → right-click `.uproject` → **Generate Visual Studio Project Files**.

### DX12 / GPU Crashes

Symptom: Flickering, artifacts, or crash mentioning D3D12.

- Switch to DX11 as fallback: Edit → Project Settings → Platforms → Windows → Default RHI → DX11. Restart editor.
- **Note:** Some UE5 features (Nanite, hardware Lumen) require DX12. DX11 mode disables them.
- On Intel Arc GPUs: ensure drivers are up-to-date. Disable hardware ray tracing: `r.RayTracing 0` in console.

### Blueprint Node Disappeared / Types Incorrect

- Did you rename a C++ class or variable? → Blueprint nodes referencing old names break. Compile C++ first, then reopen Blueprint.
- "Enum/Variable not found" → compile C++ first, then right-click Refresh Nodes in Blueprint.
- Drag-and-drop not working from Content Browser → check that the asset type matches the pin type (e.g., can't drag a Static Mesh onto a Material slot).

### Editor Crashed — Recovery

- Relaunch the editor. When prompted, UE will offer to recover unsaved changes.
- Recovered assets appear in the **Recovery Hub** on editor restart.
- Auto-save interval: Editor Preferences → Loading & Saving → Auto-Save → set to 5 minutes.

### Output Log Search Guide

| Pattern | Indicates |
|---|---|
| `LogUObjectGlobals: Error` | FObjectFinder path wrong, missing content |
| `LogPlayerManagement: Error` | Duplicate player creation in BeginPlay |
| `LogLoad: Game class is <X>` | Current GameMode — verify correct class |
| `LogStateTree: Warning` | Usually benign (PIE cleanup) |

**Benign PIE messages:** "StateTree Context Requirements failed", "Recreating Persistent SBTs", "HTTP request timed out", "Failed to load aqProf.dll".

**Debug logging:**
```cpp
DEFINE_LOG_CATEGORY(LogMyModule);  // top of .cpp
UE_LOG(LogMyModule, Log, TEXT("Val: %d, Float: %.1f"), IntVal, FloatVal);
```

### Build Error: Live Coding Active

Symptom: `Unable to build while Live Coding is active. Exit the editor and game.`

- Close all UE Editor instances completely, then retry the build.
- Alternatively, press `Ctrl+Alt+F11` in the editor to disable Live Coding for the current session, then build.

### Build Error: ANY_PACKAGE Undeclared (UE5.5+)

Symptom: `error C2065: 'ANY_PACKAGE': undeclared identifier`

`ANY_PACKAGE` was removed in UE5.5+. Replace all occurrences with `nullptr`:
```cpp
// Before:
FindObject<UClass>(ANY_PACKAGE, *ClassName);
// After:
FindObject<UClass>(nullptr, *ClassName);
```

### Blueprint Variable Name Mismatch

Symptom: `Could not find a variable named "X"` during ABP compile after copy-pasting.

UE is whitespace-sensitive in variable names. `MovementComponent` ≠ `Movement Component`. Check the **exact** name in the source ABP's My Blueprint panel and recreate with identical spelling, capitalization, and spacing in the target. Match the Category field too for clean organization.

## Appendix: Unity → UE Concept Mapping

| Unity | Unreal Engine | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GameObject | Actor (AActor) | Actor = GameObject with optional built-in networking |
| Component (MonoBehaviour) | Component (UActorComponent) | Similar pattern, UE Components can be non-spatial |
| Transform | RootComponent (USceneComponent) | Same hierarchy, UE uses FVector/FQuat/FRotator |
| Prefab | Blueprint Class | Blueprint = Prefab + inheritance + visual scripting |
| Scene | Level (.umap) | Level = persistent base level + optional sub-levels |
| SceneManager.LoadScene() | UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel() | Async loading via ULevelStreamingDynamic |
| MonoBehaviour.Awake() | AActor::BeginPlay() | BeginPlay = Start (Awake has no direct equivalent) |
| MonoBehaviour.Update() | AActor::Tick() | Can be enabled/disabled per Actor |
| MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate() | No built-in fixed framestep per Actor | Set `TickInterval` or use a Timer |
| Coroutine | Timer / Latent Action / Delay node | No direct C++ equivalent; use FTimerManager or Blueprint Delay |
| Input Manager (legacy) | Enhanced Input | Both are vastly different; Enhanced Input is asset-based |
| Animator Controller | Animation Blueprint | State machines + Blend Spaces, no Mecanim Humanoid |
| uGUI Canvas | UMG Widget Blueprint | Similar retention-mode UI, UMG has visual designer |
| ScriptableObject | DataAsset / UPrimaryDataAsset | Same purpose: data container asset |
| DontDestroyOnLoad | GameInstance | GameInstance is a dedicated persistent object |
| Raycast (Physics.Raycast) | UWorld::LineTraceSingleByChannel() | ECC channels determine what to trace against |
| Rigidbody.AddForce() | UPrimitiveComponent::AddForce() | Chaos physics instead of PhysX |
| OnCollisionEnter | OnComponentHit / OnComponentBeginOverlap | Separate events for block vs trigger |
| Build Settings → Scenes | Project Settings → Maps & Modes | Default map + GameMode set per-project |
| Layer-based collision | Collision Channels (Object Type + Response) | More granular: custom channels, per-body response |
| GetComponent\<T\>() | FindComponentByClass\<T\>() or Cast\<T\>() | Cast checks type; FindComponentByClass searches |
| Instantiate() | SpawnActor\<T\>() | Requires UWorld context |
| Destroy() | AActor::Destroy() | Garbage collector handles UObject cleanup |

## Project Knowledge Board

> Project-specific memory entries. Each entry records key paths, class names, and design decisions unique to a single project. For reuse across sessions when returning to the same project.

### ThirdPersonTest (2026-06-25)
- **UE Version**: 5.8 custom/source build, GUID `{FC15C0B3-49D4-2C64-62DD-95B5932C7147}`
- **Engine Path**: `C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.8`
- **Core Character**: `AFusedCharacter` (Variant_Fused/) — merges Combat + Platforming from three game variants
- **AnimBP**: `ABP_Fused` at `/Game/Variant_Fused/Anims/ABP_Fused`, loaded in `FusedCharacter.cpp:52`. Based on `ABP_Manny_Combat` AnimGraph + Event Graph.
- **Crouch System**: 
  - C++: `bCanCrouch = true`, `SetCrouchedHalfHeight(48.f)`, `GetIsCrouched()` BlueprintPure at `FusedCharacter.h:203-204`
  - AnimBP: Local `Is Crouched` Boolean → Locomotion state machine Crouch state → transitions with `Get Is Crouched` / `NOT`
  - **Placeholder**: Crouch state uses `BS_Idle_Walk_Run` — no real crouch animations in project. Migrate from UE4 or asset pack.
- **MCP**: Community MCP deployed at `Plugins/UnrealMCP/`, Python venv at `Plugins/UnrealMCP/Python/.venv`, opencode config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. Official `ModelContextProtocol` plugin disabled in `.uproject`.
- **Input**: 9 InputActions, IMC_Fused loaded by `FusedPlayerController`. `IA_Crouch` bound to `C` key.
- **Build Fix**: `BufferSize`→`MCPSocketBufferSize` in `MCPServerRunnable.cpp:15`; `ANY_PACKAGE`→`nullptr` in `UnrealMCPBlueprintNodeCommands.cpp` + `UnrealMCPBlueprintCommands.cpp`.

## Advanced Gameplay Patterns

### Compatible Skeleton Animation Retargeting

See §Animation → Compatible Skeleton Retargeting for the lightweight retargeting workflow (IK Rig fallback for Mixamo in UE5.8).

### C++ BlueprintPure for Animation Blueprint Access

Expose C++ state to AnimBP without long property chains:

```cpp
// In your Character header
UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure, Category="Crouch")
bool GetIsCrouched() const { return bIsCrouched; }

UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure, Category="Combat")
bool GetIsAttacking() const { return bIsAttacking; }
```

In ABP Event Graph:
```
Event Blueprint Update Animation
  → Try Get Pawn Owner → Cast to YourCharacter
  → (pure) Get Is Crouched → SET local IsCrouched
  → (pure) Get Is Attacking → SET local IsAttacking
```

No `Cast` needed after the initial owner cache. Pure functions have green pins — no execution flow required.

### Checkpoint / Respawn System

Store respawn position on the PlayerController, restore on death:

```cpp
// PlayerController stores the respawn transform
UPROPERTY()
FTransform RespawnTransform;

void SetRespawnLocation(const FTransform& NewTransform) { RespawnTransform = NewTransform; }

// Character uses it on respawn
void RespawnCharacter()
{
    SetActorLocation(GetController<AMyPlayerController>()->RespawnTransform.GetLocation());
    // Reset HP, state flags, mesh transform, collision, camera
    CurrentHP = MaxHP;
    bHasDoubleJumped = bHasWallJumped = bHasDashed = false;
    GetMesh()->SetRelativeLocation(FVector::ZeroVector);
    SetActorEnableCollision(true);
    GetCharacterMovement()->SetMovementMode(MOVE_Walking);
}
```

**Checkpoint Volume (C++):**
```cpp
// 200x200 box trigger — on overlap, update controller's RespawnTransform
void AMyCheckpointVolume::OnOverlap(AActor* Other)
{
    if (AMyCharacter* Char = Cast<AMyCharacter>(Other))
    {
        if (AMyPlayerController* PC = Cast<AMyPlayerController>(Char->GetController()))
            PC->SetRespawnLocation(Char->GetActorTransform());
    }
}
```

### Combo Attack Input Cache

Cache attack input during a fixed tolerance window to enable combo chains:

```cpp
// Properties
float ComboInputCacheTimeTolerance = 0.45f;  // window to buffer next input
float AttackCooldown = 0.2f;                  // minimum time between attacks
float AttackInputCacheTimeTolerance = 1.0f;   // buffer for initial attack
float CachedAttackInputTime = 0.0f;

void ComboAttackPressed()
{
    // Ignore if in attack cooldown
    if (GetWorld()->GetTimeSeconds() - LastAttackTime < AttackCooldown)
        return;
    
    // Cache the input time
    CachedAttackInputTime = GetWorld()->GetTimeSeconds();
    
    if (!bIsAttacking)
        ComboAttack(); // start the montage
}

void ComboAttack()
{
    bIsAttacking = true;
    PlayAnimMontage(ComboAttackMontage);
}
```

**AnimNotify chain** (placed on Montage timeline):
```
AnimNotify_CheckCombo:  // early in animation
  → if (CachedAttackInputTime within tolerance)
  → Jump to "Attack2" section in montage

AnimNotify_DoAttackTrace:  // mid-animation
  → SweepMultiByObjectType for ECC_Pawn
  → ApplyDamage to hit actors with "Player" tag

AnimNotify_AttackMontageEnded:  // end
  → bIsAttacking = false
  → Start AttackCooldown timer
```

### Substrate Material System (UE 5.5+)

UE5.5+ next-gen material system. Enable: `r.Substrate 1` (enabled by default in ThirdPersonTest):

| Substrate replaces | With |
|---|---|
| Material Domain system | Slab/Directional/Volumetric/Decal slabs |
| `Blend Mode Override` | Per-slab blending in material editor |
| PBR metallic/roughness pipeline | Explicit BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function) graph |

**Key differences for manual construction:**
- `MakeMaterialAttributes` → `MakeSubstrateMaterialAttributes`
- `SetMaterialAttributes` → `SetSubstrateMaterialAttributes`
- Common main node: `Substrate Slab BSDF` (replaces `MakeMaterialAttributes` for PBR)

Most tutorial UE5.4 materials auto-upgrade. Custom materials using `MakeMaterialAttributes` need manual conversion.

## Tool Ecosystem

### Understand-Anything Knowledge Graph

Generate an interactive project knowledge graph for AI agents:
1. Install: `pnpm install -g @understand-anything/core`
2. Run within project directory: `/understand` (in agent) or `understand --source Source/ --lang zh`
3. Output: `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` — file nodes, class/function nodes, import edges
4. Query: `understand-chat`, `understand-explain`, `understand-dashboard` skills

Scanned 95 Source files in ThirdPersonTest, producing 201 nodes + 92 edges across 7 architecture layers.

### opencode MCP Launch Prerequisite

opencode's MCP connection to Unreal Editor requires the agent to be launched FROM the project directory:

```powershell
# ❌ MCP won't connect
C:\> opencode

# ✅ MCP connects (needs .mcp.json at working dir)
C:\Users\22410\Desktop\UE-Test\ThirdPersonTest> opencode
```

The `.mcp.json` at the project root (generated by `UnrealMCP` plugin's `GenerateClientConfig`) is only discovered when opencode starts in that directory.

---

## C++ Delegates

UE's delegate system is used pervasively in engine and gameplay code. Three main types:

### Single-Cast Delegates
```cpp
DECLARE_DELEGATE(FMyDelegate);                              // no params
DECLARE_DELEGATE_OneParam(FMyIntDelegate, int32);           // one param
DECLARE_DELEGATE_RetVal(bool, FMyBoolDelegate);              // return value

// Usage
FMyDelegate MyDelegate;
MyDelegate.BindUObject(this, &AMyClass::MyFunction);
MyDelegate.ExecuteIfBound();
```

### Dynamic Delegates (Blueprint-compatible)
```cpp
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_DELEGATE(FMyDynDelegate);                   // single-cast, BP-exposed
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnDeath);               // multi-cast, BP Event Dispatcher
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_OneParam(FOnDamage, float, Amount);

// Usage
FOnDeath OnDeath;
OnDeath.Broadcast();  // multi-cast equivalent of Execute
```

### When to use which

| Type | C++ only | Blueprint | Multi-cast |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DECLARE_DELEGATE` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_DELEGATE` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (Event Dispatchers) |

Prefer `DECLARE_DELEGATE` for internal C++ callbacks, `DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE` for events exposed to Blueprint.

## Smart Pointers (TSharedPtr / TUniquePtr / TWeakPtr)

For non-UObject C++ code (Slate widgets, editor tools, utility classes), use UE's smart pointer system:

```cpp
// Shared ownership
TSharedPtr<FMyStruct> SharedData = MakeShared<FMyStruct>();
SharedData->SomeMethod();

// Unique ownership (cannot be copied)
TUniquePtr<FMyStruct> UniqueData = MakeUnique<FMyStruct>();

// Non-owning reference (prevents circular references)
TWeakPtr<FMyStruct> WeakRef = SharedData;

// Check if still valid
if (TSharedPtr<FMyStruct> Pin = WeakRef.Pin())
{
    Pin->SomeMethod();
}

// Shared reference (guaranteed non-null after creation)
TSharedRef<FMyStruct> Ref = MakeShared<FMyStruct>();
```

**Key rule:** UObjects use GC (`UPROPERTY()`). Everything else uses smart pointers. Never mix — don't `TSharedPtr` a UObject, don't `UPROPERTY()` a raw struct pointer.

## Async Loading (FStreamableManager)

For loading large assets without blocking the game thread:

```cpp
#include "Engine/StreamableManager.h"

FStreamableManager& Streamable = UAssetManager::GetStreamableManager();
FSoftObjectPath AssetPath(TEXT("/Game/Characters/Boss.Boss"));

// Async load with callback
Streamable.RequestAsyncLoad(AssetPath,
    FStreamableDelegate::CreateLambda([this]()
    {
        // Asset is loaded — safe to use synchronously now
        UObject* LoadedAsset = AssetPath.ResolveObject();
        if (UBlueprint* BP = Cast<UBlueprint>(LoadedAsset))
        {
            SpawnActor(BP->GeneratedClass);
        }
    })
);

// Batch load multiple assets
TArray<FSoftObjectPath> Paths = { Path1, Path2, Path3 };
TSharedPtr<FStreamableHandle> Handle = Streamable.RequestAsyncLoad(Paths, Delegate);
Handle->CancelHandle(); // optional: cancel if needed
```

**When to use:** Large meshes, textures, or Blueprints loaded on demand. For small/medium assets referenced directly, prefer `TSoftObjectPtr` with synchronous `LoadSynchronous()`.
